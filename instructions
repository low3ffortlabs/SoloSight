individually as separate videos.

- By default, the maximum recording length is set to 5 minute 'chunks' for 
a 60 minute total runtime. (Dashcam-style)
- To adjust this, in the 'Settings' window, type in your desired recording length
for individual chunks into the 'Chunk Minutes' box. (5-10 minutes)
- Below that, you can adjust the total recording length labeled 
'Max session minutes'. (<=60mins)
