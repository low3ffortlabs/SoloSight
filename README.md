**Welcome to SoloSight!**

I created this app (with ChatGPT's help) because I wanted to be able to use generic USB webcams on my 4Runner as 'spotter' cams since I do a lot of solo off-roading.
This app is super barebones but does include all the basic functionality for viewing and recording up to 4 webcams on any windows device.
All source code is available.

Features.

**UPDATES:**
I don't really know how to code so any and all updates will be random and infrequent. I will however post updates on here as well as the SoloSight website.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
_Hardware:_

A Windows PC (tested mainly on Win10/Win11, 64-bit preferred)

USB webcams (up to 4 supported currently, more might work but no promises)

Enough storage space for video recordings (depending on usage)


If you just run the '.exe' you don't need any dependencies.

_Software / Dependencies:_ [FOR DIRECTLY RUNNING SOURCE CODE FROM PYTHON]

Python version: Python 3.7+ (Python 3.13 works fine)

Python packages:

PyQt5 (for UI)

opencv-python (for webcam capture and video processing)

requests (for update checking and web requests)

_You can install dependencies with_: "pip install PyQt5 opencv-python requests"

**HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THE .EXE**

-Navigate to the 'Releases' page of this repo.

-Select the 'Assets' drop down.

-Download the SoloSightvx.x.x.zip (Use latest version for best results)

-If your browser warns you that it's a virus, you'll need to select 'download anyway'.

_This app may cause Windows to warn you that it's 'unsafe' or 'contains a virus' that's because I don't have a bajillion dollars to spend on a signing certificate to make Windows SmartScreen happy._

-Once downloaded, double-click the 'SoloSight.exe' and viola!


**HOW TO RUN DIRECTLY FROM PYTHON**

-Just download everything on this repo.

-Shove it all into a folder called 'SoloSight'

-Open up cmd.exe or VScode or whatever.

-Make sure you followed the checklist of dependencies from earlier.

-cd into the folder you put everything.

-Then run 'main.py'

-If that doesn't work, figure it out. I don't know wtf I'm doing and if you're on GitHub, you're probably smarter than me and can figure it out.
